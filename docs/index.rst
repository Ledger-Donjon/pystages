Welcome to pystages's documentation!
====================================

PyStages is a Python 3 library for controlling motorized stages which have a
motion controller. It has been designed for microscopy test benches automation.

The following motion controllers are currently supported (only the main
features are implemented):

- Newport SMC100 Single-Axis DC or Stepper Motion Controller
  (:class:`pystages.smc100.SMC100`)
- SMC Corvus Stepper Motor Controller (:class:`pystages.corvus.Corvus`)
- New Scale M3-FS Focus Module (:class:`pystages.m3fs.M3FS`)
- CNC Router, controlled with GRBL/GCode instructions (CNC 3018-PRO)
  (:class:`pystages.cncrouter.CNCRouter`)

The library also provides helper classes for basic vector manipulation
(:class:`pystages.Vector`) and autofocus calculation
(:class:`pystages.Autofocus`).
