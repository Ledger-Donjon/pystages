    Class to control Newport SMC100 controllers. This uses a serial device to

    Current design allows multiple instance of SMC100 to share the same

    example, we can have two XY stages using four SMC100 controllers connected
    in daisy-chain configuration.

    As specified in SMC100 controllers documentation, the address of the first
    controller in the daisy chain is always zero.
