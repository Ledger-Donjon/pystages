    Class to control Newport SMC100 controllers. This uses a serial device to

    communication channel without being considered as the same stage. For
    example, we can have two XY stages using four SMC100 controllers connected
    in daisy-chain configuration.

    As specified in SMC100 controllers documentation, the address of the first
