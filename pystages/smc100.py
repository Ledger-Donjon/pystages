    Class to control Newport SMC100 controllers. This uses a serial device to

    Current design allows multiple instance of SMC100 to share the same
    communication channel without being considered as the same stage. For
    example, we can have two XY stages using four SMC100 controllers connected
    in daisy-chain configuration.

    As specified in SMC100 controllers documentation, the address of the first
    controller in the daisy chain is always zero.
